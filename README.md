## What is a Bot?
 * A bot is a software application that is programmed to do certain tasks.
 * Bots are automated, which means they run according to their instructions without a human user needing to start them up.
 * Typically they do repetitive tasks, and they can do them much faster than human users could.

# Objective

At First this chatbot welcomes the user randomly and then asks for the users name . After than it outputs the Greeting through Voice message .And then prints the remaining message .

Then the menu will be printed in the console for the user to choose any given option.It recursivley asks for the User option unitll the user ends the chatbot.
	
Through this chatbot users can easily search the programs based on their interested topics and can even solve them by clicking the Link of the problem below the Name of the problem which will direct to the [Codeforces](codeforces.com) website where you can Code and execute  your Solution.
